This was an earlier project and a glimpse into the horizon of data analytics. Our objective was to pose a question and use Python libraries such as Pandas and Numpy to conduct an analysis on the dataset. I choose the baseball dataset, and in summary, only 32 of 139 unique teams historically have won the World Series. Furthermore, these winning teams all had similar performing team statistics when winning the championship. Only 63 times in the history of the game did teams have equal or better team statistics but fell short of a title. It was a great learning experience and looking back I was such a novice; I have successfully learned a great deal more.

#### Project Overview

In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

#### What will I learn?

After completing the project, you will:

Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and Pandas to speed up your data analysis code
Be familiar with Pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
